## Updates

### Dec 01, 2017: Breaking Changes

The Instragram API media endpoints now returns to 404-pages. After more of 20k downloads in just few month, Instagram removed the public API. However, the advanced queries are still available and a workaround will be push soon!

### Dec 09, 2017: Back on Track

The app is using a new Instragram API proxy, developed using `/graphql/query` and some web API params.

```
// GET /api/users/:user_name/media -> returns media
// Below an example with National Geographic
https://insights-for-instagram.herokuapp.com/api/users/natgeo/media 
```

### April 04, 2018: Instagram API for users ids no more public 

Unfortunately, due to changes in the Instagram API it is no longer possible to retrieve IDs for other Instagram accounts.
